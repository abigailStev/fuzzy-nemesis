Creating a power spectrum!
by Abigail L. Stevens

powerspec.py -- intended to be used with event-mode RXTE count rate data

Makes a power spectrum for a light curve. Reads in count-rate data from a FITS file, 
breaks light curve up into equal-length segments, takes power spectrum of each segment, 
averages those power spectra, applies Leahy and fractional RMS normalizations, computes 
sample frequency of averaged power spectrum, writes to a file. 

Able to geometrically re-bin the averaged power spectrum.

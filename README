Creating a power spectrum!


CONTENTS:

powerspec.py -- intended to be used with event-mode RXTE count rate data (125us 
	resolution)

Makes a power spectrum for a light curve. Reads in count rate data from a FITS file (or 
event list from an ASCII/txt/dat file and 'populates' the light curve segment), breaks 
light curve up into equal-length segments, takes power spectrum of count rate for each 
segment, averages those power spectra, applies Leahy and fractional RMS normalizations, 
computes sample frequency of averaged power spectrum, writes to a file. Able to 
geometrically re-bin the averaged power spectrum by a float constant.


This code comes with no guarantees.

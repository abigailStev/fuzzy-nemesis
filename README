Creating a power spectrum of X-ray timing data.


CONTENTS:

powerspec.py -- intended to be used with event-mode RXTE count rate data (122us 
	resolution)

Makes a power spectrum for a light curve. Reads in count rate data from a FITS file (or 
event list from an ASCII/txt/dat file and 'populates' the light curve segment), breaks 
light curve up into equal-length segments, takes power spectrum of the count rate for each 
segment, averages those power spectra over all segments, applies Leahy and fractional 
rms^2 normalizations, computes sample frequency of averaged power spectrum, writes to a 
file. Able to re-bin the averaged power spectrum by a float constant. 
Note that 'tools.py' is in my git repo 'whizzy_scripts'.
